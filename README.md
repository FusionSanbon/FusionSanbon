### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Minseok Kim

About me
===
  I am a graduate student of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Princeton University (PU). 
Before joining the PU, I completed my bachelor's degree in Physics and Artificial intelligence 
at Korea University and a master's degree in Nuclear and Quantum engineering at Korea Advanced Institute 
of Science and Technology (KAIST). I studied Bayesian statistics for KSTAR ion temperature
profile reconstruction and machine learning applications for fusion-grade hot plasma prediction
during my master's degree. 
  My current research interest is to detect edge localized mode (ELM) induced by sawtooth instability at 
DIII-D tokamak using ECE diagnostics.
